# Summary
This Excel file (color_palettes.xlsm) uses VBA to help identify colors and hex/rgb codes for use in web/app development.  The VBA code is also provided in 'ColorCodes.bas' - be sure to read the comments at the top before using the code.

Starting with the "Code to Color" sheet - you can enter either a hex code (ex. DDEBF7) or RGB code (ex. 226, 239, 218) and Excel will update the cell's background color to match.  You can use this to tweak colors until you get a palette you are happy with.  

The "Color to Code" sheet reverses this logic - you can change the cell's background color using Excel's color picker until you are happy with the palette, then click the 'Add Codes' button to run the macro and list all the hex and RGB codes in each cell for you to reference easily.

The "Saved Palettes" sheet is just provided as a place to copy/paste palettes you like and might reuse later.
